            <h3>If I had to choose, I would rather have birds than airplanes.
                -Charles Lindbergh</h3>
            <p>Birds are special creations of nature. Among the creation of Almighty, they are like tremendous wonder.
                They
                are special kinds of living beings with certain specific features that are common to all of them such as
                feathered, bipedal, winged, warm-blooded, egg-laying, etc. Almost all of them can fly high in the sky.

            <h1>Classified of Birds</h1>
            <h3>The sound of birds stops the noise in my mind.
                -Carly Simon</h3>
            <p>There are a number of birds in Bangladesh classified as domestic birds, singing birds, talking birds,
                teasing birds, migratory birds, tailor birds, game birds, plundering birds, etc. The crows and the kites
                are known as teasing birds. They steal foods, fishes, or chickens if they get any chance. For this, they
                are heated by us. The crows are uglier to look than the kites. Though the crows are very cunning, their
                habits are very unhygienic.</p>
