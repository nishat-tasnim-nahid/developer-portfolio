                -Charles Lindbergh</h3>
            <p>Birds are special creations of nature. Among the creation of Almighty, they are like tremendous wonder.
                They
                are special kinds of living beings with certain specific features that are common to all of them such as
                feathered, bipedal, winged, warm-blooded, egg-laying, etc. Almost all of them can fly high in the sky.

            <h1>Classified of Birds</h1>
            <h3>The sound of birds stops the noise in my mind.
                -Carly Simon</h3>
            <p>There are a number of birds in Bangladesh classified as domestic birds, singing birds, talking birds,
                teasing birds, migratory birds, tailor birds, game birds, plundering birds, etc. The crows and the kites
                are known as teasing birds. They steal foods, fishes, or chickens if they get any chance. For this, they
                are heated by us. The crows are uglier to look than the kites. Though the crows are very cunning, their
                habits are very unhygienic.</p>

        <h1>Difference in Migratory and Resident Birds</h1>

                <h2>Difference</h2>
                <h3>Migratory Birds</h3>
                <p>Migration is an adaptation of many insect eating birds to find more food abundant areas during food
                    scarce winters. They fly towards warmer areas of the world during cold winters and forage in the
                    food
                    abundant tropics or sub tropics.Usually, the migratory birds have a limited range of food items, and
                    mostly insectivorous. Nevertheless, they also like to feed on fish and other animal matter. Since
                    all
                    these food sources become scarce during winter season, they have to go down the latitudes to forage
                    successfully. </p>

            <div class="half-width">
                <h2>Difference</h2>
                <h3>Resident Birds</h3>
                <p>Resident birds do not fly over long distances, and they have been able to survive any climatic season
                    without spending energy to go around the world for food. One of the most important characteristics
                    of a
                    resident bird is that, they are more tolerant of many environmental conditions. One good example is
                    their ability to change the diet according to the availability.For an example, certain swan species
                    do
                    not migrate as they become omnivorous during winters but predominantly carnivorous during other
                    seasons.
